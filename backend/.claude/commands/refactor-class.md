<zadanie>
Your task is to refactor the C# class provided below. Your primary goals are to improve its **readability, maintainability, performance**, and ensure it adheres to **SOLID principles** and our project's specific architectural rules.

After refactoring, you must provide two things:

1.  The complete, refactored code for the class.
2.  A "Refactoring Summary" section below the code.

In the summary, you must create a list of the changes you made and, for each change, provide a clear justification explaining **why** you made it, referencing specific software principles (e.g., "Injected dependency X to adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle") or project rules.

### ðŸŽ¯ RULE: Result Pattern for Business Errors
