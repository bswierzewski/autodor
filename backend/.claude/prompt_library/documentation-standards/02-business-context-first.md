### ðŸŽ¯ RULE: Document the "Why", Not Just the "What"

**Rule:** Documentation, especially in the `<remarks>` section, must explain the business context, not just repeat the technical description. Answer these questions:
*   Why does this method exist? What business problem does it solve?
*   What are the key business rules it implements?
*   What are the consequences of using it (e.g., performance impact, external calls, caching strategies)?
*   What are the assumptions about input data or the system's state?
